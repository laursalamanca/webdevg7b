We chose the name BeatBox because it instantly communicates music and creativity while 
staying short, memorable, and visually strong for branding. The word “Beat” represents sounds in music while “Box” 
suggests a curated package. Together, BeatBox feels like a modern music experience that blends physical and digital 
worlds into one exciting business idea.

The name also fits the concept of delivering “a box of beats,” making it intuitive for users to understand the service
even before exploring the site. It’s fun, energetic, and perfectly aligned with the target audience of rising artists,
students, and music fans.

We chose the music and creator-based subscription industry because it sits at the intersection of culture, technology,
and fandom—three areas that are constantly evolving and full of design potential. Music lovers crave deeper connections
with the artists they follow, and creators are always looking for new ways to share exclusive content without relying
entirely on traditional streaming platforms.

Subscription services are extremely popular in today’s world, and that trend inspired us to explore how this model
could be brought into the music space in a fresh, imaginative way.
